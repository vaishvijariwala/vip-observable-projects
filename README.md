# Projects for VIP WebGen Spring 2024

The goal for these projects was to explore this new data-rich landscape by developing nimble Web Applications (Apps) using these public data. The "docs" folder contains the main code for the projects I worked on. 

Project #1 Generating images of various Pokemons using Pokemon API

Poke API: https://pokeapi.co/ 

Project #2 Accessing GDC data and creating a drop down menu of all the diseases to get information on them. (still a work in progress...) 

GDC: https://api.gdc.cancer.gov
